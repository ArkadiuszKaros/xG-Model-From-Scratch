# ⚽ Understat Data Scraper & xG Model 🌟  

Welcome to the **Understat Data Scraper & xG Model** project! This repository is dedicated to football analytics enthusiasts and data scientists who want to dive deep into the world of Expected Goals (xG) using real match data from [understat.com](https://understat.com). With this project, you can extract match statistics, analyze them, and build a predictive xG model using machine learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

### 🔍 **Data Scraping Pipeline**  
The project begins by implementing a robust web scraping algorithm to extract football match data, including:  
1. **📋 Match IDs:**  
   - Scrape all match IDs for a given league and season.  
   - Save them as structured CSV files for future processing.  

2. **📊 Match Statistics:**  
   - Retrieve detailed statistics (e.g., shots, xG, and player performance) for each match.  
   - Save the data iteratively into well-organized CSV files.  

### 🛠 **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**  
Before building the xG model, the data undergoes rigorous preprocessing, including:  
- **🔬 Data Analysis:** Explore trends, correlations, and distributions.  
- **⚙️ Feature Engineering:** Create additional features to enrich the dataset (e.g., shot types, distances).  
- **📈 Data Transformations:** Normalize, scale, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms.  

### 🤖 **xG Model Development**  
The ultimate goal is to develop an **Expected Goals (xG)** model, leveraging:  
- **📡 Machine Learning Algorithms:** Train and evaluate predictive models using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, or TensorFlow.  
- **📊 Model Evaluation:** Assess accuracy, precision, and recall to fine-tune the model for optimal performance.  

## 💡 Key Features  
- **Automation**: Fully automated scraping pipeline for seamless data collection.  
- **Scalability**: Easily adapt the scraper for multiple leagues and seasons.  
- **Customizability**: Flexible to include new features and metrics for advanced analysis.  
- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into team and player performances using xG-based metrics.  

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **🌐 Web Scraping**:  
  - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)  
  - [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)  
- **📂 Data Storage**: CSV files  
- **📈 Machine Learning**:  
  - scikit-learn  
  - XGBoost  
  - Pandas and NumPy for preprocessing
